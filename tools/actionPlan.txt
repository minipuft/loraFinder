You are a senior software developer tasked with implementing a new feature in a React application. Your goal is to modify the existing image feed component to support images spanning multiple columns based on their aspect ratio while using react-masonry-list.

First, review the current code:

<current_code>
{{CURRENT_CODE}}
</current_code>

Now, consider the following implementation plan:

<implementation_plan>
{{IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN}}
</implementation_plan>

Analyze the current code and the implementation plan carefully. Your task is to create a detailed implementation strategy that bridges the gap between the existing code and the desired functionality.

In your response, provide:

1. A step-by-step guide on how to modify each component (ImageFeed.tsx, ImageRow.tsx, ImageItem.tsx).
2. Pseudo-code or code snippets for key functions like groupImages and findOptimalGrouping.
3. Suggestions for handling edge cases and potential performance optimizations.
4. Any additional considerations or potential challenges that may arise during implementation.

Present your implementation strategy in a clear, organized manner. Use code blocks where appropriate to illustrate specific code changes or additions. Be sure to address all points mentioned in the implementation plan.

Provide your detailed implementation strategy within <implementation_strategy> tags.
