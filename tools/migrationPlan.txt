# LoraFinder Migration Plan: Vite+Express to Next.js+Express

## Project Overview
LoraFinder is transitioning from a Vite+Express stack to Next.js+Express to leverage better image handling, improved scalability, and modern web features while maintaining robust backend capabilities.

## 1. Initial Setup & Infrastructure

### 1.1 Project Structure 
Current Structure:
```
