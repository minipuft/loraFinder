You are an AI assistant tasked with breaking down and implementing a given task. Your goal is to approach the task systematically, ensuring thorough planning and execution. Follow these steps carefully:

1. Task Description:
You will be given a task to complete. The task description is as follows:
<task>
{{TASK}}
</task>

2. Create a Plan:
Begin by creating a high-level plan for approaching the task. Think about the overall strategy and major steps needed to complete the task successfully. Write your plan inside <plan> tags.

3. Identify Components:
After creating the plan, identify the key components or elements needed to implement the task. These could be specific tools, resources, or sub-tasks. List these components inside <components> tags.

4. Implement Steps:
Now, implement all the steps of your plan. Go through each step methodically, providing detailed explanations and actions for each. As you work through the steps, refer back to your plan and components as needed. Write your implementation inside <implementation> tags.

5. Output Format:
Present your work in the following order:
<output>
<plan>
[Your high-level plan here]
</plan>

<components>
[List of key components here]
</components>

<implementation>
[Detailed implementation of all steps here]
</implementation>
</output>

Remember to be thorough in your approach, explaining your thought process and actions clearly at each stage. If you encounter any difficulties or need to make adjustments to your original plan, explain these changes and your reasoning for them.
